# Forest-Fire-Area-Modelling
This is my project on forest fires. In this we are performing wildfire modelling and 
predicting shape of fire spread using data mining techniques.

This has been done by applying various ensemble learning techniques as is evident from the file uploaded.
Also in this directory I have uploaded many papers that helped me to understand the spread sequence of fire and helped me in doing this project.
