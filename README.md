# Forest-Fire-Spread-Prediction-and-Area-Modeling
This is my project on forest fires. In this I performed wildfire modelling and 
predicted shape of fire spread using data mining techniques.

This has been done by applying various ensemble learning techniques as is evident from the Jupyter notebook file uploaded. Workflow for the project is there in the png image file.
Also in this directory I have uploaded many papers that helped me to understand the spread sequence of fire and assisted me in doing this project.
